# Frame-Fade-Image-Restorer
Program that allows for restoration of frame faded images.

Approach

1 - read the image in black and white or a grayscale format and then display the grayscale image

2 - do histogram equalization on a grayscale image

3 - used a method called edge detection for checking the borders for the original image and equalised image so as to check the difference in two and also subploted them one by aside each other

4 - implemented a method called sobel detection on X and Y axis

5 - Image masking in hope of finding the difference between damaged and undamaged part

6 - Pixels

7 - Hardcoded
