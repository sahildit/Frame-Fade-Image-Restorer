# BRINGING THE PAST TO LIFE

When that old photograph has been sitting on the shelf for many years, it can be hard to notice the subtle damage years in the sun are doing. But take it out of the frame and there you will find its once crisp original state hiding behind.

Use your new-found image processing skills to restore these light-damaged photos to their former glory.

* Convert to an appropriate colourspace to exaggerate the difference between damaged and undamaged areas so as to identify the damage.
* Enhance the images to increase contrast and definition.
* Remove any colour introduced by damage.
* The final image should be an enhanced version of the original, with little or no distinction between damaged and undamaged parts.
* Start with ‘Faded.jpg’ as an easier task, then tackle ‘Damaged.jpg’. Your final design should cope with any frame-protected, light-damaged photos, i.e. pictures where the border represents the undamaged original.
